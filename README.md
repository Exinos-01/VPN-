# VPN
Overview

This task explores the practical implementation of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to understand how it enhances online privacy, secures data transmission, and protects user identity. For this purpose, **Lantern VPN**, a free and lightweight tool that does not require login, was used.

##  Tools Used

- **VPN Client:** Lantern VPN (Free, no login required)
- **Platform:** Windows
- **IP Verification:** [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

---

##  VPN Setup & Testing Process

###  Steps Performed

1. **Downloaded** Lantern VPN from the official site: [https://getlantern.org](https://getlantern.org)
2. **Installed** and launched the application on the system.
3. **Verified VPN Activation** by confirming Lantern was connected.
4. **Checked IP address before and after** using [whatismyipaddress.com].
5. **Tested website access** to observe encrypted browsing through HTTPS.
6. **Disconnected VPN** and compared browsing performance and IP status.

### Screenshots

- `lantern-connected.png` – Lantern active and connected
- `ip-before.png` – IP address before VPN connection
- `ip-after.png` – IP address after VPN activation

##  Observations

- **IP Address:** Lantern works primarily as a **browser proxy**; the IP change is only visible within browsers it routes.
- **Traffic Routing:** It selectively encrypts and reroutes traffic, unlike full-system VPNs.
- **Usability:** Lightweight and easy to set up. Good for accessing restricted websites and bypassing censorship.
- **Performance:** Minimal performance impact; browsing remains fast and stable.

###  Advantages

- No login or registration required
- Easy to use; ideal for basic privacy protection
- Helpful in accessing region-locked content

###  Limitations

- Functions more like a proxy than a full VPN
- Does not encrypt all network traffic (only browser-based)
- Not suitable for high-security tasks or full anonymity

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- VPN vs Proxy
- IP masking and identity protection
- Basic encryption awareness
- Privacy-focused traffic rerouting

## Conclusion

Through this task, I gained practical experience in setting up and testing a VPN. While Lantern VPN does not offer full encryption like traditional VPNs, it still demonstrates the fundamental concept of IP masking and restricted content access. This task reinforced key privacy and networking concepts relevant to real-world cybersecurity.
